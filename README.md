# Opportunities in routing protocols for MANETs
Research prototype to evaluate the performance of routing protocols for MANETs using a variety of broadcast approaches.
We address the following research questions:

1. Which is the performance of classic routing protocols? (baseline)
	- classic routing protocols use pure flooding as approach to broadcast and find routes between any pair of nodes
	- pure flooding creates broadcast storms that increase collisions/contentions
	- metrics to measure performance of routing protocols (<span style='color:red'>complete this list</span>):
		- packet error rate
		- delivery ratio
